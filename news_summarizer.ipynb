Here, Soledad O'Brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill. An inmate housed on the \\\"forgotten floor,\\\" where many mentally ill inmates are housed in Miami before trial. MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the \\\"forgotten floor.\\\" Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually \\\"avoidable felonies.\\\" He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman. He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor.  Go inside the 'forgotten floor' \\u00bb . At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes. Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses. Leifman says about one-third of all people in Miami-Dade county jails are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud. We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells. \\\"I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!\\\" one man shouts at me. He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House. Leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami. Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients. Leifman says 200 years ago people were considered \\\"lunatics\\\" and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered unfit to be in society. Over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals. But Leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down. Where did the patients go? Nowhere. The streets. They became, in many cases, the homeless, he says. They never got treatment. Leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals. The judge says he's working to change this. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the \\\"forgotten floor\\\"  will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment. Leifman says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start. Leifman says the best part is that it's a win-win solution. The patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again. And, for Leifman, justice is served.

NFL star Michael Vick is set to appear in court Monday. A judge will have the final say on a plea deal. Earlier, Vick admitted to participating in a dogfighting ring as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in Virginia. \\\"Your admitted conduct was not only illegal, but also cruel and reprehensible. Your team, the NFL, and NFL fans have all been hurt by your actions,\\\" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a letter to Vick. Goodell said he would review the status of the suspension after the legal proceedings are over. In papers filed Friday with a federal court in Virginia, Vick also admitted that he and two co-conspirators killed dogs that did not fight well. Falcons owner Arthur Blank said Vick's admissions describe actions that are \\\"incomprehensible and unacceptable.\\\" The suspension makes \\\"a strong statement that conduct which tarnishes the good reputation of the NFL will not be tolerated,\\\" he said in a statement.  Watch what led to Vick's suspension \\u00bb . Goodell said the Falcons could \\\"assert any claims or remedies\\\" to recover $22 million of Vick's signing bonus from the 10-year, $130 million contract he signed in 2004, according to The Associated Press. Vick said he would plead guilty to one count of \\\"Conspiracy to Travel in Interstate Commerce in Aid of Unlawful Activities and to Sponsor a Dog in an Animal Fighting Venture\\\" in a plea agreement filed at U.S. District Court in Richmond, Virginia. The charge is punishable by up to five years in prison, a $250,000 fine, \\\"full restitution, a special assessment and 3 years of supervised release,\\\" the plea deal said. Federal prosecutors agreed to ask for the low end of the sentencing guidelines. \\\"The defendant will plead guilty because the defendant is in fact guilty of the charged offense,\\\" the plea agreement said. In an additional summary of facts, signed by Vick and filed with the agreement, Vick admitted buying pit bulls and the property used for training and fighting the dogs, but the statement said he did not bet on the fights or receive any of the money won. \\\"Most of the 'Bad Newz Kennels' operations and gambling monies were provided by Vick,\\\" the official summary of facts said. Gambling wins were generally split among co-conspirators Tony Taylor, Quanis Phillips and sometimes Purnell Peace, it continued. \\\"Vick did not gamble by placing side bets on any of the fights. Vick did not receive any of the proceeds from the purses that were won by 'Bad Newz Kennels.' \\\" Vick also agreed that \\\"collective efforts\\\" by him and two others caused the deaths of at least six dogs. Around April, Vick, Peace and Phillips tested some dogs in fighting sessions at Vick's property in Virginia, the statement said. \\\"Peace, Phillips and Vick agreed to the killing of approximately 6-8 dogs that did not perform well in 'testing' sessions at 1915 Moonlight Road and all of those dogs were killed by various methods, including hanging and drowning. \\\"Vick agrees and stipulates that these dogs all died as a result of the collective efforts of Peace, Phillips and Vick,\\\" the summary said. Peace, 35, of Virginia Beach, Virginia; Phillips, 28, of Atlanta, Georgia; and Taylor, 34, of Hampton, Virginia, already have accepted agreements to plead guilty in exchange for reduced sentences. Vick, 27, is scheduled to appear Monday in court, where he is expected to plead guilty before a judge.  See a timeline of the case against Vick \\u00bb . The judge in the case will have the final say over the plea agreement. The federal case against Vick focused on the interstate conspiracy, but Vick's admission that he was involved in the killing of dogs could lead to local charges, according to CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. \\\"It sometimes happens -- not often -- that the state will follow a federal prosecution by charging its own crimes for exactly the same behavior,\\\" Toobin said Friday. \\\"The risk for Vick is, if he makes admissions in his federal guilty plea, the state of Virginia could say, 'Hey, look, you admitted violating Virginia state law as well. We're going to introduce that against you and charge you in our court.' \\\" In the plea deal, Vick agreed to cooperate with investigators and provide all information he may have on any criminal activity and to testify if necessary. Vick also agreed to turn over any documents he has and to submit to polygraph tests. Vick agreed to \\\"make restitution for the full amount of the costs associated\\\" with the dogs that are being held by the government. \\\"Such costs may include, but are not limited to, all costs associated with the care of the dogs involved in that case, including if necessary, the long-term care and/or the humane euthanasia of some or all of those animals.\\\" Prosecutors, with the support of animal rights activists, have asked for permission to euthanize the dogs. But the dogs could serve as important evidence in the cases against Vick and his admitted co-conspirators. Judge Henry E. Hudson issued an order Thursday telling the U.S. Marshals Service to \\\"arrest and seize the defendant property, and use discretion and whatever means appropriate to protect and maintain said defendant property.\\\" Both the judge's order and Vick's filing refer to \\\"approximately\\\" 53 pit bull dogs. After Vick's indictment last month, Goodell ordered the quarterback not to report to the Falcons training camp, and the league is reviewing the case. Blank told the NFL Network on Monday he could not speculate on Vick's future as a Falcon, at least not until he had seen \\\"a statement of facts\\\" in the case.  E-mail to a friend . CNN's Mike Phelan contributed to this report.\",\n          \"MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN) -- Drivers who were on the Minneapolis bridge when it collapsed told harrowing tales of survival. \\\"The whole bridge from one side of the Mississippi to the other just completely gave way, fell all the way down,\\\" survivor Gary Babineau told CNN. \\\"I probably had a 30-, 35-foot free fall. And there's cars in the water, there's cars on fire. The whole bridge is down.\\\" He said his back was injured but he determined he could move around. \\\"I realized there was a school bus right next to me, and me and a couple of other guys went over and started lifting the kids off the bridge. They were yelling, screaming, bleeding. I think there were some broken bones.\\\"  Watch a driver describe his narrow escape \\u00bb . At home when he heard about the disaster, Dr. John Hink, an emergency room physician, jumped into his car and rushed to the scene in 15 minutes. He arrived at the south side of the bridge, stood on the riverbank and saw dozens of people lying dazed on an expansive deck. They were in the middle of the Mississippi River, which was churning fast, and he had no way of getting to them. He went to the north side, where there was easier access to people. Ambulances were also having a hard time driving down to the river to get closer to the scene. Working feverishly, volunteers, EMTs and other officials managed to get 55 people into ambulances in less than two hours. Occasionally, a pickup truck with a medic inside would drive to get an injured person and bring him back up even ground, Hink told CNN. The rescue effort was controlled and organized, he said; the opposite of the lightning-quick collapse. \\\"I could see the whole bridge as it was going down, as it was falling,\\\" Babineau said. \\\"It just gave a rumble real quick, and it all just gave way, and it just fell completely, all the way to the ground. And there was dust everywhere and it was just like everyone has been saying: It was just like out of the movies.\\\" Babineau said the rear of his pickup truck was dangling over the edge of a broken-off section of the bridge. He said several vehicles slid past him into the water. \\\"I stayed in my car for one or two seconds. I saw a couple cars fall,\\\" he said. \\\"So I stayed in my car until the cars quit falling for a second, then I got out real quick, ran in front of my truck -- because behind my truck was just a hole -- and I helped a woman off of the bridge with me. \\\"I just wanted off the bridge, and then I ran over to the school bus. I started grabbing kids and handing them down. It was just complete chaos.\\\" He said most of the children were crying or screaming. He and other rescuers set them on the ground and told them to run to the river bank, but a few needed to be carried because of their injuries.  See rescuers clamber over rubble \\u00bb . Babineau said he had no rescue training. \\\"I just knew what I had to do at the moment.\\\" Melissa Hughes, 32, of Minneapolis, told The Associated Press that she was driving home when the western edge of the bridge collapsed under her. \\\"You know that free-fall feeling? I felt that twice,\\\" Hughes said. A pickup landed on top of her car, but she was not hurt. \\\"I had no idea there was a vehicle on my car,\\\" she told AP. \\\"It's really very surreal.\\\" Babineau told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune: \\\"On the way down, I thought I was dead. I literally thought I was dead. \\\"My truck was completely face down, pointed toward the ground, and my truck got ripped in half. It was folded in half, and I can't believe I'm alive.\\\"  See and hear eyewitness accounts \\u00bb . Bernie Toivonen told CNN's \\\"American Morning\\\" that his vehicle was on a part of the bridge that ended up tilted at a 45-degree angle. \\\"I knew the deck was going down, there was no question about it, and I thought I was going to die,\\\" he said. After the bridge settled and his car remained upright, \\\"I just put in park, turned the key off and said, 'Oh, I'm alive,' \\\" he said.

MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the \"forgotten floor.\" Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually \"avoidable felonies.\" He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow...   \n",

And there's cars in the water, there's cars on fire.

The polyps were removed and sent to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for routine microscopic examination, spokesman Scott Stanzel said. Results are expected in two to three days. All were small, less than a centimeter [half an inch] in diameter, he said. Bush is in good humor, Stanzel said, and will resume his activities at Camp David. During the procedure Vice President Dick Cheney assumed presidential power. Bush reclaimed presidential power at 9:21 a.m. after about two hours.

              "4  (CNN)  -- The National Football League has indefinitely suspended Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick without pay, officials with the league said Friday. NFL star Michael Vick is set to appear in court Monday. A judge will have the final say on a plea deal. Earlier, Vick admitted to participating in a dogfighting ring as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in Virginia. \"Your admitted conduct was not only illegal, but also cruel and reprehensible. Your team, the NFL, and NFL fans have all been hurt by your actions,\" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a letter to Vick. Goodell said he would review the status of the suspension after the legal proceedings are over. In papers filed Friday with a federal court in Virginia, Vick also admitted that he and two co-conspirators killed dogs that did not fight well. Falcons owner Arthur Blank said Vick's admissions describe actions that are \"incomprehensible and unacceptable.\" The suspension makes \"a strong statement that...   \n",

A former euthanasia supporter warned of a surge in deaths if Parliament allowed doctors to give deadly drugs to their patients. \\u2018Don\\u2019t do it Britain,\\u2019 said Theo Boer, a veteran European watchdog in assisted suicide cases. \\u2018Once the genie is out of the bottle, it is not likely ever to go back in again.\\u2019 Scroll down for video . How the toll has risen: The Netherlands has seen deaths double in just six years . His . native Netherlands, where euthanasia has been legal since 2002, has . seen deaths double in just six years and this year\\u2019s total may reach a . record 6,000. Professor . Boer\\u2019s intervention comes as peers prepare to debate the Assisted Dying . Bill, promoted by Lord Falconer, a Labour former Lord Chancellor. The . bill, which has its second reading next week, would allow doctors to . prescribe poison to terminally ill and mentally alert people who wish to . kill themselves. Professor . Boer, who is an academic in the field of ethics, had argued seven years . ago that a \\u2018good euthanasia law\\u2019 would produce relatively low numbers of . deaths. Peers are preparing to debate the Assisted Dying Bill which was promoted by Lord Falconer, a Labour former Lord Chancellor . But, speaking in a . personal capacity yesterday, he said he now believed that the very . existence of a euthanasia law turns assisted suicide from a last resort . into a normal procedure. A . \\u2018slippery slope\\u2019 for assisted dying in Britain would mean that . euthanasia would follow the same path as abortion, which was legalised . in 1967. There are now . nearly 200,000 terminations a year. Anti-euthanasia campaigners and . disability activists called on politicians to listen to the professor\\u2019s . warning. The Paralympian, Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, said: \\u2018What Dr Boer says comes as no surprise. \\u2018An . assisted dying law is playing with fire, especially when there are no . safeguards in place. Lord Falconer\\u2019s bill just isn\\u2019t fit for purpose.\\u2019 Baroness . Jane Campbell, who is a disability rights campaigner, said: \\u2018As happens . in Holland, Lord Falconer\\u2019s bill could end up encompassing significant . numbers of seriously ill people.\\u2019 Euthanasia . is now becoming so prevalent in the Netherlands, Professor Boer said, . that it is \\u2018on the way to becoming a default mode of dying for cancer . patients\\u2019. He said . assisted deaths have increased by about 15 per cent every year since . 2008 and the number could hit a record 6,000 this year. He . said he was concerned at the extension of killing to new classes of . people, including the demented and the depressed, and the establishment . of mobile death units of \\u2018travelling euthanasing doctors\\u2019. Activists, . Professor Boer said, continue to campaign for doctor-administered death . to be made ever easier and \\u2018will not rest\\u2019 until a lethal pill is made . available to anyone over 70 who wishes to die.\\u2018Some slopes truly are slippery,\\u2019 he added. The . Utrecht University academic has been a member since 2005 of a review . committee charged with monitoring euthanasia deaths. Its role includes a . duty to \\u2018tell doctors how their actions in particular cases are likely . to stand up to legal, medical and ethical scrutiny\\u2019. Professor Boer admitted he was \\u2018wrong \\u2013 terribly wrong, in fact\\u2019 to have believed regulated euthanasia would work. \\u2018I used to be a supporter of the Dutch law. But now, with 12 years of experience, I take a very different view. Theo Boer (left) warned of a surge in deaths which Tanni Grey-Thompson (right) said came as no surprise . \\u2018Whereas . in the first years after 2002 hardly any patients with psychiatric . illnesses or dementia appear in reports, these numbers are now sharply . on the rise. \\u2018Cases have . been reported in which a large part of the suffering of those given . euthanasia or assisted suicide consisted in being aged, lonely or . bereaved. \\u2018Some of . these patients could have lived for years or decades. Pressure on . doctors to conform to patients\\u2019 \\u2013 or in some cases relatives\\u2019 \\u2013 wishes . can be intense. \\u2018Pressure . from relatives, in combination with a patient\\u2019s concern for their . wellbeing, is in some cases an important factor behind a euthanasia . request. Not even the review committees, despite hard and conscientious . work, have been able to halt these developments.\\u2019 The latest euthanasia figures for the Netherlands show that nearly one in seven deaths are at the hands of doctors. Dignitas is Zurich-based organisation which helps people to kill themselves.  Candidates have to fill in an official form to prove they want to commit suicide . In . 2012, there were 4,188 deaths by direct euthanasia \\u2013 3 per cent of all . deaths \\u2013 and 3,695 deaths by direct euthanasia in 2011. The . figures do not include deaths by terminal sedation, where patients are . rendered unconscious before they are dehydrated and starved to death, an . act often referred to as \\u2018euthanasia by omission\\u2019. This practice accounts for more than 12 per cent of all deaths in the country. The . Netherlands is following a pattern that anti-euthanasia campaigners say . has happened wherever the practice has been legalised. Doctors . in neighbouring Belgium are collectively killing an average of five . people every day by euthanasia \\u2013 with a 27 per cent surge in one year. Dignity . in Dying, the pressure group which supports Lord Falconer\\u2019s bill, . dismissed fears that the legislation might lead to similar horrors. Its . spokesman James Harris said: \\u2018Lord Falconer\\u2019s Assisted Dying Bill will . not legalise euthanasia, rather assisted dying for adults who are . terminally ill and mentally competent, similar to legislation in Oregon . which has been working safely for over 17 years and has never been . extended beyond the criteria of terminal illness.\\u2019 Anti-euthanasia campaigners dispute that the Oregon law is safe or that limited numbers are dying at their own request. Elspeth . Chowdharay-Best, honorary secretary of Alert, the anti-euthanasia . pressure group, said legalising assisted suicide would be like \\u2018stepping . off a precipice\\u2019. \\u2018It means that you would lose the right to live,\\u2019 she . said. \\u2018It is more serious than people realise.\\u2019 Under Lord Falconer\\u2019s bill, a terminally-ill patient would be able to ask for drugs to kill him or herself. Two . doctors would need to approve, and to be satisfied the patient was of . sound mind and settled view, and had not been influenced by others. In 2001 The Netherlands was the first country in the world to legalise euthanasia and, along with it, assisted suicide. Various \\u2018safeguards\\u2019 were put in place to show who should qualify and doctors acting in accordance with these \\u2018safeguards\\u2019 would not be prosecuted. Because each case is unique, five regional review committees were installed to assess every case and to decide whether it complied with the law. For five years after the law became effective, such physician-induced deaths remained level - and even fell in some years. In 2007 I wrote that \\u2018there doesn\\u2019t need to be a slippery slope when it comes to euthanasia. A good euthanasia law, in combination with the euthanasia review procedure, provides the warrants for a stable and relatively low number of euthanasia.\\u2019 Most of my colleagues drew the same conclusion. But we were wrong - terribly wrong, in fact. In hindsight, the stabilisation in the numbers was just a temporary pause. Beginning in 2008, the numbers of these deaths show an increase of 15% annually, year after year. The annual report of the committees for 2012 recorded 4,188 cases (compared with 1,882 in 2002). 2013 saw a continuation of this trend and I expect the 6,000 line to be crossed this year or the next. Euthanasia is on the way to become a \\u2018default\\u2019 mode of dying for cancer patients. Alongside this escalation other developments have taken place. Under the name \\u2018End of Life Clinic,\\u2019 the Dutch Right to Die Society NVVE founded a network of travelling euthanizing doctors. Whereas the law presupposes (but does not require) an established doctor-patient relationship, in which death might be the end of a period of treatment and interaction, doctors of the End of Life Clinic have only two options: administer life-ending drugs or send the patient away. On average, these physicians see a patient three times before administering drugs to end their life. Hundreds of cases were conducted by the End of Life Clinic. The NVVE shows no signs of being satisfied even with these developments. They will not rest until a lethal pill is made available to anyone over 70 years who wishes to die. Some slopes truly are slippery. Other developments include a shift in the type of patients who receive these \\u2018treatments\\u2019. Whereas in the first years after 2002 hardly any patients with psychiatric illnesses or dementia appear in reports, these numbers are now sharply on the rise. Cases have been reported in which a large part of the suffering of those given euthanasia or assisted suicide consisted in being aged, lonely or bereaved. Some of these patients could have lived for years or decades. Whereas the law sees assisted suicide and euthanasia as an exception, public opinion is shifting towards considering them rights, with corresponding duties on doctors to act. A law that is now in the making obliges doctors who refuse to administer euthanasia to refer their patients to a \\u2018willing\\u2019 colleague. Pressure on doctors to conform to patients\\u2019 (or in some cases relatives\\u2019) wishes can be intense. Pressure from relatives, in combination with a patient\\u2019s concern for their wellbeing, is in some cases an important factor behind a euthanasia request. Not even the Review Committees, despite hard and conscientious work, have been able to halt these developments. I used to be a supporter of the Dutch law.\\u00a0 But now, with twelve years of experience, I take a very different view. At the very least, wait for an honest and intellectually satisfying analysis of the reasons behind the explosive increase in the numbers. Is it because the law should have had better safeguards? Or is it because the mere existence of such a law is an invitation to see assisted suicide and euthanasia as a normality instead of a last resort? Before those questions are answered, don\\u2019t go there. Once the genie is out of the bottle, it is not likely to ever go back in again.Theo Boer has been a Member of a Regional Review Committee since 2005. For the Dutch Government, five such committees assess whether a euthanasia case was conducted in accordance with the Law. In the past nine years, Prof. Boer has reviewed almost 4,000 euthanasia cases. The views expressed here represent his views as a professional ethicist, not of any institution.\",\n          \"A Facebook page seeking to preserve the 'Black Pete' clowns in blackface who accompany St. Nicholas to the Netherlands during the holidays has become the fastest-growing Dutch-language page ever, receiving 1 million 'likes' in a single day. The popularity of the 'Pete-ition' page reflects the emotional attachment most Dutch have to a figure that helped launch the tradition of Santa Claus. It also reflects their anger at critics who call it racist. Those critics include foreigners who they feel don't understand the tradition. They also include many of the country's most prominent black people. Facebook page: The U.N. has condemned the Christmas tradition but a Facebook page set up in support of it has attracted huge attention . 'Don't let the Netherlands' most beautiful tradition disappear,' the page says. On Tuesday, the chairwoman of a U.N. Human Rights Commission panel condemned it. 'The working group does not understand why it is that people in the Netherlands cannot see that this is a throwback to slavery, and that in the 21st century this practice should stop,' Verene Shepherd told television program EenVandaag. In stories told to children, St. Nicholas - Sinterklaas in Dutch - arrives by steamboat from Spain in mid-November accompanied by a horde of helpers: 'Zwarte Pieten,' or 'Black Petes', who have black faces, red lips and curly hair. A public broadcaster produces a daily fictional news program about Sinterklaas and the Petes that is shown in schools for several weeks. On December 5, families read poems and exchange presents as part of the Dutch-Belgian festival that is one of the main sources of the Santa Claus traditions. Opponents say Pete is an offensive caricature of black people. Supporters say Pete is a positive figure whose appearance is harmless. Popular: A musician dressed up as 'Black Pete' during last year's Christmas celebrations . The traditional song refers to Pete as a 'servant' to the elderly saint, but in recent years those references have been replaced with the idea that he is black from chimney soot as he scrambles down to deliver toys and sweets for children who leave their shoes out overnight. Discussion about Zwarte Piet has escalated since 2011, when a prominent opponent was thrown to the ground, handcuffed by police and dragged away for wearing a T-shirt reading 'Black Pete is Racism'. Opposition has been centered in Amsterdam, home to the Netherlands' largest black community. Mayor Eberhard van der Laan this month said he would support changing Pete's appearance - but only gradually, as it has changed over time in the past. 'If it appears that Amsterdammers feel pain as a result of this tradition, that's a good reason for new development,' he said. Controversial: Many claim that the tradition is offensive towards black people . Organizers of the festival and the broadcaster also said they would be open to changes if people want them. The latest public figure to speak out against the tradition was the man who has played the part of 'Head Pete' on the Sinterklaas news program for more than a decade. His commentary appeared in a top Dutch newspaper on Tuesday, entitled 'Make me less black and less a servant.' Others to question the tradition include Victoria's Secret model Doutzen Kroes. But their campaign has failed to draw widespread support and the overwhelming majority of Dutch people don't want change. 'Message for the U.N.: Isn't there a war somewhere, starvation or genocide going on that you could better be concerned about?' Dutchman Peter Udo commented on the Facebook page. His comment attracted more than 2,000 likes. Prime Minister Mark Rutte said it isn't his place to intervene in a folk tradition. 'Black Pete: The name says it already. He's black,' he said. 'I can't change much about it.'\",\n          \"A group calling itself 'The Women of the 99 Percent' is making robocalls across the United States in an attempt to link Republican members of the House of Representatives to 'the war on women led by Rush Limbaugh'. The automated calls are illegal because they do not state who they are from (there is no known group called The Women of the 99 Percent) or provide a callback number, as required under the U.S. Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991. They appear to be the most aggressive attempt yet by Democrats to exploit politically the recent furore over comments by the controversial conservative radio talk show host. Scroll down to hear the call . Controversy: Rush Limbaugh kicked off a national firestorm with his comments . Limbaugh apologised last Sunday for his 'insulting word choices' when speaking about Sandra Fluke, a student activist campaigning for contraception to be paid for by Georgetown University, a Catholic institution, under President Barack Obama's healthcare reform. The radio host had said she was a 'slut' because she was asking to be paid for having sex and then commented that she should repay the public by releasing videos of her sexual activities 'so we can all watch'. Limbaugh's comments had been widely denounced, including by John Boehner, Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Barack Obama, in what Republicans branded an attempt to make political capital, telephoned Fluke to commiserate. Democrats have been taking Republicans to task over the comments. David Axelrod, the Obama campaign's top strategist, said that Mitt Romney, the Republican frontrunner, had failed 'a test of leadership' over 'the Limbaugh thing'. He ask how if a candidate couldn't stand up to 'the most strident voices in your party, how can he stand up to Ahmadinejad?' Activist: The radio host called Sandra Fluke a 'slut' after she spoke out in favour of easy access to contraception . A call left on the answering machine of Paula Bolyard of Doylestown, Ohio yesterday stated: 'Hello, this is a message from Women of the 99 Percent. Congressman Jim Renacci is condoning the war on women led by Rush Limbaugh, who has become the de facto leader of the Republican party. 'Call Congressman Renacci at 330-489-4414 and ask him why he remains silent while Republican spokesman Rush Limbaugh insults, degrades, and verbally abuses women. Tell Congressman Renacci that it\\u2019s just plain shameful that he that he allows Rush Limbaugh\\u2019s behaviour to continue. We are the Women of the 99 Percent and we won\\u2019t be silent anymore.' As well Mrs Bolyard's Ohio-16 district of Representative Jim Renacci, there were similar calls in Rep. Roscoe Bartlett's Maryland-6, Rep. Dan Benishek's Michigan-1, Rep. Judy Biggert's Illinois-13, Rep. Tim Johnson's Illinois-15, Rep. Bobby Schilling's Illinois-17 and Rep. Scott Rigell's Virginia-2. The robocalls prompted hundreds of angry calls to Republican congressional offices. Target: Constituents of Ohio Republican Jim Renacci have been contacted by a robocall focussed around Mr Limbaugh . Mrs Bolyard sent out a tweet about the call and then posted an audio file of it on the RedState website after being contacted by MailOnline. In a blog post, she wrote: 'Apparently, unless you are throwing a public temper tantrum about Rush\\u2019s inappropriate and malicious comments, you are \\\"condoning\\\" them. By this standard, 99 per cent of the country is guilty.' She added: 'We should all feel great compassion for the poor souls who had to answer the phones and listen to the angry rants that resulted from these robocalls.' A blogger called 'Corinthian Scales' from Michigan wrote that the claim against Rep Dan Benishek was 'one wildly outrageous accusation to make by an unidentified \\\"group\\\" who, by the way, is now intruding into the privacy of my home. 'Hmmm... no number shows on the caller ID, and *69 only prompts the phone company's recorded message that they are unable to determine the phone number used.' Criticism: John Boehner, Speaker of the Hous of Representatives, is one of many Republicans to have spoken out against Mr Limbaugh . Last week, the Democratic . Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) organised a petition accusing . Republicans of having 'launched an all-out war on women'. The . petition said that Republicans were 'trying to silence women who stand . against their radical agenda' and Americans had witnessed 'top . Republican leaders squirm at denouncing or even criticising Rush . Limbaugh after he called women's health care advocate Sandra Fluke a . \\\"slut\\\" and a \\\"prostitute\\\" on his radio show.' Phil Bloomer, spokesman for Rep. Johnson, said that some people calling as a result of the robocalls were not even in the congressman's district but part of a new district created after boundary changes he will be running for in November - a sign the calls are linked to this year's elections. He said: 'How do we not \\\"allow\\\" Rush Limbaugh to say what he wants? We believe in free speech. At the same time, we don\\u2019t condone name-calling or caustic language from either the Left or Right. That is why Representative Johnson formed the Center Aisle Caucus in 2005 and continually advocates civility.' Andrea Pivarunas, spokeswoman for Rep. Schilling, said: 'We were surprised to hear this since Representative Schilling spoke out about this days ago. 'He stated Mr Limbaugh\\u2019s comments on the religious freedom issue are deplorable and wrong, just as he also feels that the Obama Administration is wrong to violate the religious conscience rights of others. We hope the organisation spreading these inaccurate statements will issue a retraction.' Telephone calls and emails to the DCCC and the Democratic National Committee asking whether either organisation was connected to the robocalls were not returned. Listen to the call .

The polyps were removed and sent to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for routine microscopic examination, spokesman Scott Stanzel said. Results are expected in two to three days. All were small, less than a centimeter [half an inch] in diameter, he said. Bush is in good humor, Stanzel said, and will resume his activities at Camp David. During the procedure Vice President Dick Cheney assumed presidential power. Bush reclaimed presidential power at 9:21 a.m. after about two hours. Doctors used \"monitored anesthesia care,\" Stanzel said, so the president was asleep, but not as deeply unconscious as with a true general anesthetic.

NFL star Michael Vick is set to appear in court Monday. A judge will have the final say on a plea deal. Earlier, Vick admitted to participating in a dogfighting ring as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in Virginia. \"Your admitted conduct was not only illegal, but also cruel and reprehensible. Your team, the NFL, and NFL fans have all been hurt by your actions,\" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a letter to Vick. Goodell said he would review the status of the suspension after the legal proceedings are over. In papers filed Friday with a federal court in Virginia, Vick also admitted that he and two co-conspirators killed dogs that did not fight well.

The polyps were removed and sent to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for routine microscopic examination, spokesman Scott Stanzel said. Results are expected in two to three days. All were small, less than a centimeter [half an inch] in diameter, he said.

              "4  (CNN)  -- The National Football League has indefinitely suspended Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick without pay, officials with the league said Friday. NFL star Michael Vick is set to appear in court Monday. A judge will have the final say on a plea deal. Earlier, Vick admitted to participating in a dogfighting ring as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in Virginia. \"Your admitted conduct was not only illegal, but also cruel and reprehensible. Your team, the NFL, and NFL fans have all been hurt by your actions,\" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a letter to Vick. Goodell said he would review the status of the suspension after the legal proceedings are over.

A stray pooch in Washington State has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car, apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive. That's according to Washington State University, where the dog -- a friendly white-and-black bully breed mix now named Theia -- has been receiving care at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Four days after her apparent death, the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm, dirt-covered and emaciated, where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help. She was taken in by Moses Lake, Washington, resident Sara Mellado. \\\"Considering everything that she's been through, she's incredibly gentle and loving,\\\" Mellado said, according to WSU News. \\\"She's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life.\\\" Theia is only one year old but the dog's brush with death did not leave her unscathed. She suffered a dislocated jaw, leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity -- and still requires surgery to help her breathe. The veterinary hospital's Good Samaritan Fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog's treatment, but Mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog's care. She's also created a Facebook page to keep supporters updated. Donors have already surpassed the $10,000 target, inspired by Theia's tale of survival against the odds. On the fundraising page, Mellado writes, \\\"She is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw. I agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home.\\\" She is dedicated to making sure Theia gets the medical attention she needs, Mellado adds, and wants to \\\"make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again!\\\" Any additional funds raised will be \\\"paid forward\\\" to help other animals. Theia is not the only animal to apparently rise from the grave in recent weeks. A cat in Tampa, Florida, found seemingly dead after he was hit by a car in January, showed up alive in a neighbor's yard five days after he was buried by his owner. The cat was in bad shape, with maggots covering open wounds on his body and a ruined left eye, but remarkably survived with the help of treatment from the Humane Society.\",\n          \"(CNN)A Duke student has admitted to hanging a noose made of rope from a tree near a student union, university officials said Thursday. The prestigious private school didn't identify the student, citing federal privacy laws. In a news release, it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review. The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday, the university said. Officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved. Criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well. Students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting \\\"We are not afraid. We stand together,\\\"  after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media. At a forum held on the steps of Duke Chapel, close to where the noose was discovered at 2 a.m., hundreds of people gathered. \\\"You came here for the reason that you want to say with me, 'This is no Duke we will accept. This is no Duke we want. This is not the Duke we're here to experience. And this is not the Duke we're here to create,' \\\" Duke President Richard Brodhead told the crowd. The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students. Last month a fraternity at the University of Oklahoma had its charter removed after a video surfaced showing members using the N-word and referring to lynching in a chant. Two students were expelled. In February, a noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the University of Mississippi. A statement issued by Duke said there was a previous report of hate speech directed at students on campus. In the news release, the vice president for student affairs called the noose incident a \\\"cowardly act.\\\" \\\"To whomever committed this hateful and stupid act, I just want to say that if your intent was to create fear, it will have the opposite effect,\\\" Larry Moneta said Wednesday. Duke University is a private college with about 15,000 students in Durham, North Carolina. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.\",\n          \"(CNN)If you've been following the news lately, there are certain things you doubtless know about Mohammad Javad Zarif. He is, of course, the Iranian foreign minister. He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. \\\"Long live Zarif,\\\" crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is \\\"polished\\\" and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, \\\"jovial.\\\" An Internet search for \\\"Mohammad Javad Zarif\\\" and \\\"jovial\\\" yields thousands of results. He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community. But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known. Here are six: . In September 2013, Zarif tweeted \\\"Happy Rosh Hashanah,\\\" referring to the Jewish New Year. That prompted Christine Pelosi, the daughter of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, to respond with a tweet of her own: \\\"Thanks. The New Year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran's Holocaust denial, sir.\\\" And, perhaps to her surprise, Pelosi got a response. \\\"Iran never denied it,\\\" Zarif tweeted back. \\\"The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year.\\\" The reference was likely to former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had left office the previous month. Zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by Ahmadinejad's successor, Hassan Rouhami. His foreign ministry notes, perhaps defensively, that \\\"due to the political and security conditions of the time, he decided to continue his education in the United States.\\\" That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of Iran, which began in 1977, and during the Iranian Revolution, which drove the shah from power in 1979. Zarif left the country in 1977, received his undergraduate degree from San Francisco State University in 1981, his master's in international relations from the University of Denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the University of Denver in 1988. Both of his children were born in the United States. The website of the Iranian Foreign Ministry, which Zarif runs, cannot even agree with itself on when he was born. The first sentence of his official biography, perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in Tehran, says Zarif was \\\"born to a religious traditional family in Tehran in 1959.\\\" Later on the same page, however, his date of birth is listed as January 8, 1960. And the Iranian Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961 . So he is 54, 55 or maybe even 56. Whichever, he is still considerably younger than his opposite number, Kerry, who is 71. The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the Alavi Foundation, a charitable organization. The U.S. Justice Department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the Iranian government to launder money and get around U.S. sanctions. But last year, a settlement in the case, under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in Manhattan along with other properties to the U.S. government, did not mention Zarif's name. Early in the Iranian Revolution, Zarif was among the students who took over the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco. The aim, says the website Iranian.com -- which cites Zarif's memoirs, titled \\\"Mr. Ambassador\\\" -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently Islamic. Later, the website says, Zarif went to make a similar protest at the Iranian mission to the United Nations. In response, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations offered him a job. In fact, he has now spent more time with Kerry than any other foreign minister in the world. And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men, with help from other foreign ministers as well, try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in Switzerland.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"highlights\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Theia, a bully breed mix, was apparently hit by a car, whacked with a hammer and buried in a field .\\n\\\"She's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life,\\\" says Sara Mellado, who is looking for a home for Theia .\",\n          \"Student is no longer on Duke University campus and will face disciplinary review .\\nSchool officials identified student during investigation and the person admitted to hanging the noose, Duke says .\\nThe noose, made of rope, was discovered on campus about 2 a.m.\",\n          \"Mohammad Javad Zarif has spent more time with John Kerry than any other foreign minister .\\nHe once participated in a takeover of the Iranian Consulate in San Francisco .\\nThe Iranian foreign minister tweets in English .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"230c522854991d053fe98a718b1defa077a8efef\",\n          \"c27cf1b136cc270023de959e7ab24638021bc43f\",\n          \"4495ba8f3a340d97a9df1476f8a35502bcce1f69\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

A stray pooch in Washington State has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car, apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive. That's according to Washington State University, where the dog -- a friendly white-and-black bully breed mix now named Theia -- has been receiving care at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Four days after her apparent death, the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm, dirt-covered and emaciated, where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help. She was taken in by Moses Lake, Washington, resident Sara Mellado. \"Considering everything that she's been through, she's incredibly gentle and loving,\" Mellado said, according to WSU News. \"She's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life.\" Theia is only one year old but the dog's brush with death did not leave her unscathed.

And he received a hero's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. \"Long live Zarif,\" crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is \"polished\" and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, \"jovial.\" An Internet search for \"Mohammad Javad Zarif\" and \"jovial\" yields thousands of results.

              "0  (CNN)The Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court on Wednesday, a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories. The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague, in the Netherlands, where the court is based. The Palestinians signed the ICC's founding Rome Statute in January, when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed \"in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014.\" Later that month, the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis. As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well. Israel and the United States, neither of which is an ICC member, opposed the Palestinians' efforts to join the body.

              "1  (CNN)Never mind cats having nine lives. A stray pooch in Washington State has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car, apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive. That's according to Washington State University, where the dog -- a friendly white-and-black bully breed mix now named Theia -- has been receiving care at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Four days after her apparent death, the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm, dirt-covered and emaciated, where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help. She was taken in by Moses Lake, Washington, resident Sara Mellado. \"Considering everything that she's been through, she's incredibly gentle and loving,\" Mellado said, according to WSU News. \"She's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life.\" Theia is only one year old but the dog's brush with death did not leave her unscathed. She suffered a dislocated jaw, leg injuri...   \n",
              "2  (CNN)If you've been following the news lately, there are certain things you doubtless know about Mohammad Javad Zarif. He is, of course, the Iranian foreign minister. He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. \"Long live Zarif,\" crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is \"polished\" and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, \"jovial.\" An Internet search for \"Mohammad Javad Zarif\" and \"jovial\" yields thousands of results. He certainly has gone a long way to bring Iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community. But there are some facts about Zarif that are less well-known. Here are six: .

One of the five had a heart-related issue on Saturday and has been discharged but hasn't left the area, Taylor Wilson wrote. The others have already gone home. They were exposed to Ebola in Sierra Leone in March, but none developed the deadly virus. They are clinicians for Partners in Health, a Boston-based aid group.

The prestigious private school didn't identify the student, citing federal privacy laws. In a news release, it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review. The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday, the university said. Officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved. Criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well. Students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting \"We are not afraid. We stand together,\"  after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media.

The Australian men are expected to be led from their isolated cells in Batu prison through the wildly dense tropical forest up a 3km steep winding track to a place\\u00a0called Nirbaya - or more appropriately known as Death Valley. Scroll down for video . Myuran Sukumaran (left) and Andrew Chan (right) will be given white clothing to wear and a choice whether to be blindfolded as they face the firing squad at the stoke of midnight on Tuesday . The final chilling steps to execution in Indonesia . A disturbing recreation of the execution was aired on Indonesian TV the day before five foreign drug traffickers were killed in January . Millions of viewers watched the chilling reenactment of the execution played out on national TV . The condemned pair will be given white clothing to wear, which symbolises the afterlife, before beginning their fatal trek and are given the option to be blindfolded with a piece of fabric before facing the firing squad who will be lined up anywhere from five to 10 metres in front of them. The confronting decisions continue for the death row inmates with the opportunity to choose whether to stand, sit or kneel before a cross is placed over their hearts acting as a target for the 12 riflemen - of which nine will have blanks and only three will have live rounds. If necessary their hands or feet will be tied to a 3m high pole or worse still - a wooden execution chair. The offender is then given a final chance to calm down for a maximum of three minutes before the riflemen are ordered to shoot them in the heart. It is then that the executing commander brandishes his sword as a sign for the 12 shooters to begin to fire their rifles. If the doctor confirms once the fires have been shot that the prisoner is still breathing -\\u00a0the executing commander orders for a pistol be put to the temple just above the ear for a final shot. However, the shooting can continue on the condemned, if the doctor declares that there is still signs of life. Some of the last words the men  will hear are 'laksanakan, laksanakan' - meaning 'execute, execute' in Indonesian. The Australian men will be given a maximum of three minutes to calm down before being shot in the heart . Three shooters will have live rounds while nine other rifelemen will have blanks . The TV footage broadcasted four months ago showed Brimob executioners dressed in military fatigues with semi-automatic rifles practicing for the following day's execution by repeatedly firing at bullseye targets . Not even refusing to sign their death warrants on Saturday will delay the pair's deaths for their hand in plotting to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of Bali 10 years ago. The stark reality struck for the pair when they requested their final wishes - Sukumaran to continue his love of painting right up until the bitter end and Chan, who became a minister during his time behind bars, to attend a church service with his family. The prisoners can also make a final written request which can include declaring their guilt or innocence, along with how and where they wish to be buried. One of the last paintings Sukumaran will ever create was shown to the media on the Javanese island by his Australian lawyer Julian McMahon on Saturday. The haunting self portrait depicts a gun shot wound to his heart. This comes as coffins with both men's names and Wednesday's date were inscribed on wooden crosses by local funeral director Suhendra Putro.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia on Monday, David Hawley said: 'It's a real shock, he was one of the fittest men I've ever met \\u2013 he's swimming everyday.' Responding to a question about whether Angus had a history of heart problems, David answered: 'No, no, not that we know of', adding: 'He's so fit, I don't understand.' Scroll down for video . 'He didn't have heart problems' Angus Hawley's brother reveals shock after ex-husband of Antonia Kidman dies from a suspected heart attack in New York after 'returning from a swim'. Angus and Antonia pictured together in 2005 at the Chuan Spa opening in the Langham Hotel . Mr Hawley, who was in New York attending a business conference at the time, collapsed after returning from a swim. 'He did go for a big swim in the morning, he trains very hard,' David said of his brother, who he described as a 'bit of a fitness fanatic' and was known to lead a healthy and active lifestyle. 'I think his body clock was round the wrong way and it just got everything round the wrong way and he's over done it.' Mr Hawley was a father to four children, Lucia, 16, Hamish, 14, James, 12, and Sybella, eight, all of whom he shared with Nicole Kidman's sister Antonia before their 2007 split. The children are reportedly set to join the family in Sydney as they rally around David's second wife Prue Fisher, who he married in Palm Beach in 2011. Sad news: Antonia Kidman's former husband Angus Hawley has died of a suspected heart attack aged 46 in New York. The pair are seen here in 2003 . Fitness fanatic: Mr Hawley's brother says he doesn't 'understand' the death of his fit and healthy brother, pictured with his wife Prue Fisher in 2011 . Led an active lifestyle: Mr Hawley, 46, is believed to have suffered a heart attack after returning from a swim. The former couple are pictured above with Antonia's parents Janelle and the late Dr. Antony Kidman . David described his brother, a business development manager at Valor Private Wealth,\\u00a0as 'one of the most beautiful men that I have ever known. 'He is absolutely adored by everybody, he made everybody feel like he's their best friend and that's why everybody loved him. And he loved everybody else, it's just a really emotional time.' Prue is being comforted by her family in Sydney, after they traveled from Orange in New South Wales to be by her side. She was reportedly seen at the Bondi Icebergs public pool, a place her late husband often frequented, on Sunday. Moved on: Both Antonia and Mr Hawley remarried following their divorce in 2007 - she to businessman Craig Marran (L) in 2010, and he to Sydney fashion boutique manager Prue  the following year (R) David described Prue as 'devastated' saying she's 'terrible, terrible', adding, 'it's a huge hole in our lives. 'They were absolutely devoted to each other and Prue's relationship with Angus's children was fantastic,' said David of his late brother's wife. 'His wife adores him, and he adored her, his four children, it's just so sad. It's a tragic loss to our family and to his family, it's just a nightmare. 'No matter what happens for the rest of her life, she'll still be my sister-in-law.' On Saturday another of Angus's brothers Phillip released a statement, describing his death as 'sudden' and 'very unexpected' to\\u00a0News.com.au. Wedding day: Antonia and Angus wed in 1996, they were together for 11 years before their divorced was finalised in 2007 .

Reports about his death have as yet been mixed, with News.com.au saying that Mr Hawley went to dinner with a friend in New York and then went into cardiac arrest. He is said to have later passed away in the ambulance on the way to hospital. Mr Hawley's death comes less than seven months after the sudden passing of Nicole and Antonia's father Dr. Antony Kidman, who also  suffered a suspected heart attack, in Singapore. Family tragedy: Mr Hawley's death comes less than seven months after the sudden passing of Nicole and Antonia's father Dr. Antony, who also suffered a heart attack, in Singapore . Both 44-years-old Antonia and her ex husband both remarried following their divorce in 2007 - she to businessman Craig Marran in 2010, and he to Sydney fashion boutique manager Prue, the following year. He has kept himself largely out of the spotlight following his split from Antonia and a battle with depression. The father of four checked himself into a Sydney rehab clinic in 2007 following a period of mental health issues. Tragic: Antonia's second husband Craig Marran accompanied her, her sister Nicole and husband Keith Urban to Dr. Antony's funeral in September last year . He told Woman's Day in 2009: 'I was depressed, out of control and full of self-loathing, and I resorted to drugs to get through it. 'I wasn't in a happy place and it was an appalling thing, but I was sick, and at least I was big enough to do something about it.'

Support: Keith and Craig acted as pallbearers at the funeral, as did family friends Russell Crowe and Channel Nine newsreader Peter Overton . 'He was my next door neighbour but quickly became a best friend, one I was fortunate enough to have by my side ever since,' he said, describing Mr Hawley as 'the most caring, thoughtful and loving man.' 'The most loving father to his four wonderful children and adoring wife. His family was his treasure. His kids were his life,' he continued. Mr Hawley's death is the second devastating loss the Kidman family has suffered in the past seven months, after Dr. Antony Kidman sadly collapsed and died in a Singapore hotel last September at the age of 75. Family photo: Antonia, Janelle, Dr. Antony and Nicole are seen here in 1990. Nicole said at his funeral she was 'so lucky' to be her father's daughter .

She remembered the close relationship she had with her father at his funeral last year and said they were 'similar in many ways'. New home: Antonia resides in Singapore with second husband Craig. She's pictured here with Nicole, who lives in Nashville with Keith Urban, in 2005 . 'I'm so lucky to be his daughter,' 47-year-old Nicole said, 'and that he chose my mother to make me with.' Appearing on Ellen\\u00a0last October, Nicole said husband Keith Urban had to carry her, sometimes literally, because she was 'so devastated' by the loss. Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Kidman family's management. Tribute: A good friend of Mr Hawley, Merivale founder Justin Hemmes has described him as 'the most caring, thoughtful and loving man'\",\n          \"It is a week which has seen him in deep water - both on and off the pitch. Just days after Dallas Cowboys' Greg Hardy was suspended from 10 NFL games he appeared to get into trouble when he drove his luxury car through flash floods in Dallas, getting stuck when the car could not make it through the rising, fast flowing waters. The 25-year-old was forced to abandon his Bentley, leaving it stranded until the waters receded and the car could be towed away. It took the tow truck several hours to successfully remove the car and Hardy was later seen returning to the vehicle to collect some of his possessions. He left in another luxury car, a white Ferrari. Scroll down for video . Greg Hardy found himself in more deep water when he was forced to abandon his Bentley in flash floods . The problem with his car comes as more bad news for Hardy who was suspended by the NFL just days ago\\u00a0after an incident of domestic abuse that allegedly occurred last year. Hardy, who signed with the Dallas Cowboys last month, will be forced to sit out the first 10 games of the season and will not receive his salary for these games. Last year Hardy, 25, was convicted by a judge in Charlotte, North Carolina of beating, strangling and threatening to kill his ex-girlfriend, Nicki Holder.\\u00a0Those charges were later dropped on an appeal when Holder could not be located to testify. A two month investigation by the NFL followed and officials decided he had to be suspended. Hardy was informed in a letter from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell that the probe determined there was 'sufficient credible evidence that Hardy engaged in conduct that violated NFL policies in multiple respects.' Hardy was dropped by his previous team, the Carolina Panthers, because of these charges last season, but was still able to collect his salary during that time, which was roughly $770,000 a week. Hardy previously played for the Carolina Panthers but was dropped after allegations of domestic abuse emerged and was then signed by Dallas Cowboys and suspended for 10 games by the NFL . Hardy is seen talking to officials after his Bentley got stuck in flash floods in Dallas this week . 'I understand that I need to step away from football right now and take care of this legal matter,' Hardy said in a statement after he was cut from the Panthers. The Panthers had originally agreed to wait to take action until Hardy had a jury trial regarding the incident in May. His previous conviction was the result of a bench trial. A jury trial ultimately led to all charges being dropped. Holder told police that Hardy choked her, slammed her against a bathtub, threw her to the floor and threatened to kill her after a fight at his Charlotte condo. The Dallas Cowboys star was seen attempting to drive his Bentley during the floods, but had to abandon it . It took officials and a tow truck several hours to pull the luxury Bentley free from Dallas flood waters . This all came at a time when the league was under heavy scrutiny in the wake of two abuse scandals involving stars Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson. Many were upset with the punishments those two received, feeling the NFL was too lenient. Video of Rice punching then-fianc\\u00e9e Janay Palmer went public last Monday, and Peterson was indicted on charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child on Friday for an incident in which he hit his son with a switch back in May. Hardy (above) was convicted by a judge last July of beating, strangling and threatening to kill ex-girlfriend Nicki Holder . The NFL announced  that Hardy would be suspended without pay for 10 games at the start of the 2015 season . Holder (above with Hardy) told police that he choked her, slammed her against a bathtub, threw her to the floor and threatened to kill her after a fight at his condo . Rice was definitely suspended from the NFL and had his contract terminated by the Baltimore Ravens, while Peterson, who was sidelined by the Minnesota Vikings last Sunday, has now been suspended by the team. Both men are expected by many to return to play in the 2015, with Peterson back on the Vikings after an NFL decision and Rice winning a wrongful termination suit during the off-season. Rice even pocketed roughly $1.6million in back pay.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"highlights\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Bali Nine ringleaders will face the firing squad at midnight on Tuesday .\\nAndrew Chan and Myruan Sukumaran have requested their last wishes .\\nThe men will likely be executed at a place called Nirbaya, aka 'Death Valley'\\nWhite clothing will be given to them to wear which represents the after life .\\nA cross will be placed over their heart as a target for the riflemen .\\nThey can choose to stand, sit or kneel before facing their demise .\\nThey are then given a maximum of three minutes to calm down .\\nThree shooters will have live rounds and nine other will have blanks .\\nIf doctor confirms prisoner is still breathing - final shot fired to side of head .\",\n          \"Angus Hawley's brother said his late sibling 'didn't have heart problems'\\nHe is reported to have had a suspected heart attack in New York .\\nAngus was a father of four children - Lucia, Hamish, James and Sybella .\\nHe had all four with Nicole Kidman's sister Antonia before their 2007 split .\\nBoth 44-year-old Antonia and Angus, 46, remarried following their divorce .\\nAngus' death comes seven months after Dr. Antony Kidman's death .\\nNicole and Antonia's father also died of a heart attack in Singapore .\",\n          \"Hardy was convicted of domestic abuse against ex-girlfriend Nicki Holder and was suspended from the Dallas Cowboys for 10 days by the NFL .\\nCharges were eventually dropped after Holder could not be located when Hardy's lawyers appealed the decision and asked for a jury trial .\\nThis week he got stuck in his Bentley in deep flash flood waters in Dallas .\\nHardy was forced to abandon his car and it was towed away hours later .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"fe89a6a2e28d173e5ad4c6d814c15b95aa969e3f\",\n          \"b4a1738c4a0acdf3d189264a0927005aa5b856d6\",\n          \"ded2f535cd6ab95d11b5f4ea29bbf2b2d3c55c50\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

They might be better served singing The Grand Old Duke of York. Only those 10,000 men on that hill could possibly relate to the absurdities of Bournemouth\\u2019s afternoon engagement with Sheffield Wednesday. In sequence, they went from top to third to second to top to second again in the space of one 2-2 draw. They are neither up nor down; they are neither falling apart nor running away with the loot. How delightfully fitting in this remarkable season of Championship football that a team unbeaten in 10 before Saturday\\u2019s kick-off would draw at home to a side with nothing to gain or lose. Chris Maguire converts an injury time penalty so salvage a draw for Sheffield Wednesday at Dean Court . Maguire celebrates his late, late strike as the Owls held Bournemouth to a draw on their home turf . The battle for automatic promotion to the Premier League is hotting up with three points covering four teams and with two games to play. 1 Watford 85pts To play Apr 25 Brighton (a), May 2 Sheff Wed (h) 2 Bournemouth 84pts Apr 27 Bolton (h), May 2 Charlton (a) 3 Middlesbrough 84pts Apr 25 Fulham (a), May 2 Brighton (h) 4 Norwich 82pts Apr 25 Rotherham (a), May 2 Fulham (h) And how. They dominated, then they trailed, then they levelled and had a man sent off. Then their fans got mocked by a Wednesday player and then they led and then the player that did the mocking scored a penalty in stoppage time that irritated the home crowd all over again. Brilliantly bonkers. How significantly will Chris Maguire of Wednesday feature in Bournemouth\\u2019s final analysis? How serious was Eddie Howe when he indicated that the referees feel Bournemouth, at 15 kicks, have reached their quota for penalties this season? He was unhappy, to put it mildly, that Lewis Buxton was cleared of fouling Callum Wilson in the second half, telling a radio station: \\u2018It looked like the referees have come together and talked about Callum Wilson and said, \\u201cDon\\u2019t give him any penalties because Bournemouth have had too many this season and we don\\u2019t want them to have any more\\u201d.\\u2019 Kieran Lee (second right) celebrates with his team after his\\u00a036th minute header put the visitors ahead . He toned down his sentiments by the time he met the written press and that is probably for the best. Howe is a good and rational man; certainly one of the most upwardly mobile and promising of all English coaches. A sign of the pressure of this incredible promotion race, then? Who could blame him if it was? Middlesbrough had beaten Norwich on Friday night to take Bournemouth\\u2019s place at the top and at 3.36pm on Saturday Kieran Lee put Wednesday in front. When Craig Cathcart scored a magnificent volley for Watford against Birmingham \\u2014 the only goal of the match \\u2014 Watford were top and Bournemouth were third. The natives grew restless. Then Yann Kermorgant equalised, lifting Bournemouth back up to second, and a home fan screamed into a camcorder held by a policeman. Senses take leave at this time of a season, which might also explain how Simon Francis quickly landed himself a second yellow card. Maguire turned to the home fans and motioned for them to dry their eyes. Alas, Matt Ritchie then hit the top corner and put Bournemouth top again but in stoppage time Adam Smith fouled Atdhe Nuhiu for a penalty. \\u2018No-one will blame Adam,\\u2019 Howe said. \\u2018We will tell him how much we love him tonight.\\u2019 Yann Kermorgant (second left equalises for the Cherries with 20 minutes of the contest remaining . Bournemouth's Simon Francis is dismissed by referee Paul Tierney in the 78th minute . Which is nice, though Maguire did score the penalty and Bournemouth did fall. Again. Howe said he felt \\u2018heartbroken\\u2019. Over the course of two spells at Bournemouth he has led them from League Two to this precipice, occasionally spending his own money in the darker days when the club was broke. Today, in their tiny stadium where parking costs \\u00a31 and stewards are encouraged to say hello, they are so close to something incredible. Tommy Elphick, Bournemouth\\u2019s captain, gave something of an insight into what his manager has been going through. \\u2018He is probably the first one every day in at 6 or 7 and probably leaving at 6 or 7 at night and the players follow suit,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018We realise how much he does for us. When a single person gives that much of their life towards you, you only want to repay them.\\u2019 But the best intentions can only do so much in a race like this. Promotion is worth somewhere in the region of \\u00a3120million and, as of the weekend, eight teams are in the hunt for three spots. Multiple narratives, multiple charges and multiple futures on the line. It\\u2019s crazy but it\\u2019s brilliant. With only two games to play it has been a magnificent race up the hill. Matt Ritchie races away to celebrate after his 85th minute free kick put the home side ahead for the first time .\",\n          \"A professor testifying in a cold-case trial in Southern California said Thursday that she was intimidated into identifying her rapist to the man now charged with killing him in 1995. Norma Esparza, who pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the case and agreed to testify, said from the stand that her ex-boyfriend, Gianni Van, now 45, was outraged when he heard about the assault and demanded that she find and point out Gonzalo Ramirez at the bar where she met him. Van is now charged with the murder of Ramirez. Prosecutors allege Van and friends kidnapped and beat Ramirez and left him by the roadside. 'I was intimidated': Norma Esparza, pictured here during a press conference in 2013, testified Thursday at the murder trial of ex-boyfriend, Gianni Van, 45, who is charged with killing a man in 1995 she claims raped her. She says Van intimidated her into identifying the murder victim,\\u00a0Gonzalo Ramirez . Accused: Gianni Van, 45, (left) is accused of the 1995 murder of Gonzalo Ramirez (right), whose blindfolded, bloodied body was found on the side of an Irvine, California road having suffered 30 blows with a cleaver . 'We were sitting around a booth next to an entrance or exit, and at some point I see Gonzalo Ramirez walk by,' Esparza said of the night in 1995, according to the Orange County Register. 'When I see him, I cringe,' she said, showing how she reacted by bending her head down and putting her face in her hands. 'I didn't want to see him again.' Esparza, testifying in the trial's second day, said she was 'broken' by the assault, that Van was directing his anger not just at her attacker but at her, and that she did not know what Van and his friends would do once she pointed out Ramirez. 'He would just insult me,' she said. 'He would rant and just be explosive.' Revenge? Prosecutors say Van killed Ramirez as revenge for raping his on-and-off girlfriend Norma Esparza (pictured). They divorced and Esparza went on to become a psychology professor in Europe and the mother of a little girl (left). Esparza is pictured right upon her arrest while re-entering the U.S. in 2012 . Van's lawyer, Jeremy Dolnick, said his client had no role in the murder and knew nothing of any plans to kidnap or kill Ramirez. The case has drawn international attention since Esparza \\u2014 who went on to become a psychology professor and moved to France \\u2014 was arrested in 2012, provoking an outcry from advocates for sexual assault victims who say the case sends a chilling message to rape survivors. Esparza, 40, is expected to receive a six-year sentence in exchange for testifying at the trials of Van and another defendant. During opening statements this week, Senior Deputy District Attorney Mike Murray showed graphic photos of Ramirez's blindfolded, mangled body lying on the side of the road in a pool of blood. 'Gonzalo Ramirez was targeted, and he was targeted by somebody who was going to make sure he suffered,' Murray said. 'Whether Norma Esparza was sexually assaulted or not, for our purposes today, doesn't matter. What matters is she told the defendant that. Involved? The prosecution alleges Van was aided by his friend Kody Tran (center) \\u00a0and Tran's wife Diane Tran (right) as well as Tran's employee Shannon Gries (left). Kody Tran killed himself during an unrelated standoff with police in 2013. Diane Tran has taken a plea deal and will testify against Van. Shannon Gries awaits trial on murder charges . Prosecutors say Ramirez was taken to the transmission shop of his friend Kody Tran, where he was blindfolded, chained up and beaten. They say he was found having suffered 30 blows from a meat cleaver, reports the Orange County Register. The prosecution alleges Van was aided by Tran and Tran's wife Diane Tran as well as Tran's employee Shannon Gries. His body was found dumped on the side of a road in Irvine. 'It was beyond horrific,' Murray said. 'It was the act of an incredibly angry man...The defendant was out of his mind with anger.' 'He felt that he had been violated,' Murray said of Van.\",\n          \"A 51-year-old mother   fought off an intruder after finding him standing over her young daughter.

He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. \"Long live Zarif,\" crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is \"polished\" and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, \"jovial.\" An Internet search for \"Mohammad Javad Zarif\" and \"jovial\" yields thousands of results.

The Palestinians signed the ICC's founding Rome Statute in January, when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed \"in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014.\" Later that month, the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis.

A stray pooch in Washington State has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car, apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive. That's according to Washington State University, where the dog -- a friendly white-and-black bully breed mix now named Theia -- has been receiving care at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Four days after her apparent death, the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm, dirt-covered and emaciated, where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help. She was taken in by Moses Lake, Washington, resident Sara Mellado. \"Considering everything that she's been through, she's incredibly gentle and loving,\" Mellado said, according to WSU News. \"She's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life.\" Theia is only one year old but the dog's brush with death did not leave her unscathed.

He has been U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against Iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero's welcome as he arrived in Iran on a sunny Friday morning. \"Long live Zarif,\" crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is \"polished\" and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, \"jovial.\" An Internet search for \"Mohammad Javad Zarif\" and \"jovial\" yields thousands of results.

The prestigious private school didn't identify the student, citing federal privacy laws. In a news release, it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review. The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday, the university said. Officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved. Criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well. Students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting \"We are not afraid. We stand together,\"  after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media.

The historic occasion was the first ever Major League Soccer match -- a brave new dawn for the world's favorite sport in a land its charms had yet to conquer. Summarizing the action for ESPN, commentator Ty Keough eagerly described the momentous \\\"birth of a new era for American soccer.\\\" Looking back at footage from that balmy evening now it's hard not to feel a certain nostalgia. Baggy shirts, questionable hairstyles and strange rule adaptations to make games more exciting were all part of the formative MLS experience. Countdown clocks were employed to provide drama at the end of each half. Even more bizarrely, tied games were settled by shootouts that saw attacking players run with the ball from 35-yards out before attempting to beat the opposing goalkeeper. As the MLS prepares to mark the beginning of its 20th season, it's hard to comprehend just how much the league has progressed in the intervening period. Long gone is the desire to tamper with the rules of the game for a start. Attendances are higher than ever before while the number of teams involved has doubled from 10 in the 1996 campaign to 20 in 2015. A further four are set to be added by 2020. On top of this, the new season is the first of a new domestic TV and media rights deal with FOX, ESPN and Univision worth $700 million over eight years. This figure may pale beside the $5.1 billion recently paid by UK broadcasters for the English Premier League, the richest football league in the world, but it represents a tripling in value of the previous MLS deal. According to Phil Rawlins, co-primary owner and president of the new MLS franchise, Orlando City Soccer Club, \\\"the industry and the game itself has moved on dramatically\\\" in the U.S.. He believes what would equal 50 years growth in most other industries has been experienced in the first two decades of the MLS. Rawlins' club is a prime example of this rapid transformation. He describes players being pushed out of changing facilities because of a schedule clash with a yoga class not so long ago. This weekend 60,000 fans are expected to witness Orlando City's opening weekend fixture against New York City, another new club making their MLS bow. World Cup winners Kaka and David Villa will turn out for Orlando and New York City respectively. \\\"We're just on the crest of the wave at the moment,\\\" Rawlins said of football's American progress. \\\"Can it be the number two, number three sport in this country? Yes, I think it can. And it can be in a short space of time.\\\" These positive assertions are backed by the huge interest U.S. fans showed in last year's World Cup in Brazil. Team USA's group stage clash with Portugal attracted 25 million viewers, according to figures from TV ratings firm, Nielsen. That's considerably more than the 15 million baseball's 2013 World Series averaged on FOX or the similar audience that tuned into the 2014 NBA finals on ABC. Anyone who saw 20,000 pumped-up young fans pack out Chicago's Grant Park to cheer on their country via big screens, meanwhile, would find it hard to argue against soccer in the U.S. now being anything other than a big deal. Reaching this promising stage, however, has been anything but a smooth ride. The MLS was reported to have lost as much as $250 million in its first five years while average attendances initially dwindled after the inaugural season. Three teams -- Miami Fusion, Tampa Bay Mutiny (both in 2001) and Chivas USA (2014) -- were disbanded along the way due to a mixture of lack of fan interest and ownership troubles. A report by Forbes at the end of 2013, meanwhile, claimed that only 10 out of 19 MLS teams were profitable. And as recently as this week, MLS players looked like they could be going on strike over wages and the right of players to become free agents when their contracts end. Then there's the way the league develops, attracts and trades players. A salary cap restricts the amount teams can spend on playing squads. Each side, however, has a number of spaces that can be allocated to \\\"off budget\\\" signings which are not included within the cap. This includes promising Generation Adidas players who enter the MLS through the draft systems before completing their college education. Homegrown players from club's development academies are also exempt as are a maximum of three designated players (DPs), usually stellar international names whose wages and transfer fees will be covered by club owners or sponsors. One of the main criticisms of the MLS and its complex player acquisition rulebook is that while it does entice prominent stars of the game like David Beckham, Freddie Ljungberg and Thierry Henry to appear in the MLS, it only does so when their careers are on a downward trajectory. Why would an exceptional player want to move to a league that can only attract a handful of top talents at any one time, after all? And herein lies one of the leagues biggest challenges in attracting and keeping the talented players fans want to see. Although the likes of the salary cap encourages fiscal probity, it means MLS teams are restricted by rules clubs in other markets are not. Head coach of Sporting Kansas, Peter Vermes, highlighted these difficulties in comments carried by the Kansas City Star newspaper last year. \\\"We're in a place where at times you can't compete with foreign clubs because of the kind of dynamics they have in regards to finances. We have a salary cap. They don't,\\\" Vermes said. According to Paulo Teixeira, a football agent who has worked to bring in and sell players from the league in recent years, current philosophies with regards player-trading may be have to be tweaked to help the MLS grow yet further. He describes the importance of placing an emphasis on attracting younger players with European passports. Such talented individuals will have a sell-on value that can be recouped by the league and their clubs if they move on from the MLS to the biggest and wealthiest leagues across the Atlantic. Theoretically, at least, this money can then be reinvested in the league, player development and attracting yet more promising players to the MLS. This in turn will raise the standard further. An early example of this strategy can perhaps be found in the transfer of Oriol Rossell, a Spanish midfielder who moved from Sporting Kansas to Sporting Lisbon last year in a deal brokered by Teixeira. Rossell arrived on a free transfer aged 20 after being released by FC Barcelona in 2012. He excelled at Kansas, winning the MLS Cup before being sold to the Portuguese giants at a profit in June 2014. Teixeira is quick to make clear such plans would need good scouting systems to truly flourish. It could also be achieved by signing DPs closer to the peak stage of their career, he added. This last point is something that appears be happening already. \\\"Before they used to have a lot of big names who could no longer run in Europe,\\\" Teixeira said. \\\"(But) Villa is not an old guy, (Frank) Lampard is still going strong\\\" and both could still offer something to teams in Europe, he said by way of example of New York City's first DP signings. Nevertheless, he continued, the signing of more young players with big potential  \\\"is probably something we'll see more of.\\\" Whether Teixeira is correct will become apparent in the months and years ahead. Either way, that brave new MLS dawn that broke over San Jose back in 1996 has turned into a bright morning.

The search has drawn hundreds of volunteers on foot and online. The parents of Cayman Naib, 13, have been communicating through the Facebook group \\\"Find Cayman\\\" since a day after his disappearance, according to close friend David Binswanger. Newtown Police say Cayman was last seen wearing a gray down winter jacket, black ski pants and hiking boots. He could be in the Radnor-Wayne area, roughly 20 miles from Philadelphia, or may have purchased a train ticket to Philadelphia, according to an alert posted on Facebook. \\\"We think that he got a email from school and was upset by it and left as an impulsive act,\\\" Farid Naib, Cayman's father, wrote Thursday on the group page. \\\"We have spoken to his friends and they do not know where he is. Cayman does have his phone, we don't know if he has any cash, he does not have his wallet.\\\" The parents said that his phone was out of power at the time. \\\"Cayman left within 30 minutes after he received an email from school regarding overdue home work (we do not blame the school) and most probably did not do any pre planning ... He is a good kid, and has no substance abuse or other issues, this is the first time he has ever done anything like this,\\\" his father and mother, Becky Naib, posted Friday. The parents wrote Saturday that Cayman was not wearing waterproof clothing and that he did not take his backpack. Binswanger said weather limited search efforts Wednesday, the night Cayman went missing. Wednesday it was rainy and Thursday there was 6-8 inches of snow. Hundreds of volunteers have stepped up to pass out fliers and to canvass areas, according to posts. A post late Saturday explained search efforts included \\\"advanced, geo-spacial tracking software to determine the exact locations where searchers went,\\\" and added that the search would be taken to the skies Sunday with deployment of the Civil Air Patrol. In many posts, the families appealed directly to their son. \\\"Cayman, if you read this please know that you are forgiven for everything, and I mean everything, you have the ultimate free pass. Just come home, we are so worried about you\\\" the family posted Saturday. A message to families from the head of The Shipley School, which Cayman attends, read in part: \\\"Cayman's sister Savannah is in ninth grade at Shipley and his parents, Farid and Becky, are terrific people. They have contacted police and are aware that we are sending you this email. We hope that Cayman is ok and are saying our prayers.\\\" CNN could not immediately get in touch with police or the FBI.\",\n          \"(CNN)French striker Bafetimbi Gomis, who has a history of fainting, said he is now \\\"feeling well\\\" after collapsing during Swansea's 3-2 loss at Tottenham in the Premier League on Wednesday. The worrying incident occurred in the first half at White Hart Lane -- after Tottenham scored in the seventh minute -- but the 29-year-old left the pitch conscious following about five minutes of treatment. The Guardian added that he was wearing an oxygen mask. Play was temporarily stopped before resuming. As the match progressed, Swansea tweeted that Gomis was \\\"fine,\\\" with manager Garry Monk using the same word to describe Gomis' condition. Gomis spent the night in hospital as a precaution, Swansea said on its website. \\\"I wanted to reassure you concerning my health,\\\" Gomis told the website. \\\"It actually looks much scarier than it is physically dangerous, and I am feeling well now. \\\"I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father's health, which requires me to go back and forth from France. \\\"I was disappointed that I couldn't help my team tonight, but now everything is back in order. I also want to thank everyone for their support and get well messages.\\\" Gomis had similar fainting spells in France, which prompted the president of his former club, Jean-Michel Aulas of Lyon, to tell French television in 2009: \\\"We can't not be worried, it scares you each time.\\\" Swansea ran tests on Gomis, said Monk, prior to signing him on a free transfer last July. \\\"He just has a little bit of low blood pressure which causes you a little bit of problems,\\\" Monk said in a televised interview on Sky. \\\"It's been part of his life. We were well aware of that when we signed him. He's done all the hospital checks and all the medical checks you can possibly do and it's just part of his life. \\\"It's no problems whatsoever. It's not as serious as it looks.\\\" Gomis has scored two league goals for Swansea this season, mostly in a backup role. He became the Welsh side's top striker when Wilfried Bony signed with Manchester City in January. Almost exactly three years ago at White Hart Lane, then Bolton midfielder Fabrice Muamba collapsed after suffering a cardiac arrest. He was near death,  according to Bolton, but survived after being treated at the London Chest Hospital. He subsequently retired. Other footballers, including Cameroon international Marc-Vivien Foe in 2003 and Spanish international Antonio Puerta in 2007, didn't survive after collapsing on the pitch.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"highlights\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The 20th MLS season begins this weekend .\\nLeague has changed dramatically since its inception in 1996 .\\nSome question whether rules regarding salary caps and transfers need to change .\",\n          \"Cayman Naib, 13, hasn't been heard from since Wednesday .\\nPolice, family, volunteers search for eighth-grader .\",\n          \"Bafetimbi Gomis collapses within 10 minutes of kickoff at Tottenham .\\nBut he reportedly left the pitch conscious and wearing an oxygen mask .\\nGomis later said that he was \\\"feeling well\\\"\\nThe incident came three years after Fabrice Muamba collapsed at White Hart Lane .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"4157bc4da185971e2742f349d69a037343bc0d95\",\n          \"2e6613d531843515bf5401286cc3e45c4df530d2\",\n          \"60736693e3b1b32d14337a317190c6606e879a85\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

That may sound like an esoteric adage, but when Zully Broussard selflessly decided to give one of her kidneys to a stranger, her generosity paired up with big data. It resulted in six patients receiving transplants. That surprised and wowed her. \"I thought I was going to help this one person who I don't know, but the fact that so many people can have a life extension, that's pretty big,\" Broussard told CNN affiliate KGO. She may feel guided in her generosity by a higher power. \"Thanks for all the support and prayers,\" a comment on a Facebook page in her name read. \"I know this entire journey is much bigger than all of us. I also know I'm just the messenger.\" CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the page.

Baggy shirts, questionable hairstyles and strange rule adaptations to make games more exciting were all part of the formative MLS experience. Countdown clocks were employed to provide drama at the end of each half.

The Guardian added that he was wearing an oxygen mask. Play was temporarily stopped before resuming. As the match progressed, Swansea tweeted that Gomis was \"fine,\" with manager Garry Monk using the same word to describe Gomis' condition.

That may sound like an esoteric adage, but when Zully Broussard selflessly decided to give one of her kidneys to a stranger, her generosity paired up with big data. It resulted in six patients receiving transplants. That surprised and wowed her. \"I thought I was going to help this one person who I don't know, but the fact that so many people can have a life extension, that's pretty big,\" Broussard told CNN affiliate KGO. She may feel guided in her generosity by a higher power. \"Thanks for all the support and prayers,\" a comment on a Facebook page in her name read. \"I know this entire journey is much bigger than all of us. I also know I'm just the messenger.\" CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the page.

              "1  (CNN)On the 6th of April 1996, San Jose Clash and DC United strode out in front of 31,683 expectant fans at the Spartan Stadium in San Jose, California. The historic occasion was the first ever Major League Soccer match -- a brave new dawn for the world's favorite sport in a land its charms had yet to conquer. Summarizing the action for ESPN, commentator Ty Keough eagerly described the momentous \"birth of a new era for American soccer.\" Looking back at footage from that balmy evening now it's hard not to feel a certain nostalgia. Baggy shirts, questionable hairstyles and strange rule adaptations to make games more exciting were all part of the formative MLS experience. Countdown clocks were employed to provide drama at the end of each half. Even more bizarrely, tied games were settled by shootouts that saw attacking players run with the ball from 35-yards out before attempting to beat the opposing goalkeeper. As the MLS prepares to mark the beginning of its 20th season, it's hard t...   \n",
              "2  (CNN)French striker Bafetimbi Gomis, who has a history of fainting, said he is now \"feeling well\" after collapsing during Swansea's 3-2 loss at Tottenham in the Premier League on Wednesday. The worrying incident occurred in the first half at White Hart Lane -- after Tottenham scored in the seventh minute -- but the 29-year-old left the pitch conscious following about five minutes of treatment. The Guardian added that he was wearing an oxygen mask. Play was temporarily stopped before resuming. As the match progressed, Swansea tweeted that Gomis was \"fine,\" with manager Garry Monk using the same word to describe Gomis' condition. Gomis spent the night in hospital as a precaution, Swansea said on its website. \"I wanted to reassure you concerning my health,\" Gomis told the website. \"It actually looks much scarier than it is physically dangerous, and I am feeling well now. \"I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father's health, which requires me to go back and f...   \n",
              "3  (CNN)It was an act of frustration perhaps more commonly associated with golf's fictional anti-hero Happy Gilmore than the world's reigning No 1. player. But when Rory McIlroy pulled his second shot on the eighth hole of the WGC Cadillac Championship into a lake Friday, he might as well have been channeling the much loved Adam Sandler character. Before continuing his round with a dropped ball, the four-time major winner launched the 3-iron used to play the offending shot into the water as well. \"(It) felt good at the time,\" a rueful McIlroy later said of the incident in comments carried by the PGA Tour website. \"I just let frustration get the better of me. It was heat of the moment, and I mean, if it had of been any other club I probably wouldn't have but I didn't need a 3‑iron for the rest of the round so I thought, why not.\" The club \"must have went a good 60, 70 yards,\" he joked.

Photographer Graham Hewer captured the jaw-dropping encounter during a visit to Kruger National Park in South Africa .

The bold impala survived the strange meeting, which photographer Graham Hewer puts down to the crocodile not feeling hungry . His snaps then show the lone impala drinking from the watering hole, moments before its encounter with the crocodile. The final photo shows the crocodile alone, with its razor-sharp teeth visible inside its gaping mouth. Graham, a self-taught photographer from the South African capital of Pretoria, revealed he watched on in suspense, expecting the crocodile to kill the impala almost instantly.

An amusing video shows the pigs leaving the beach and paddling through the crystal clear water as they make their way towards the boat. The pigs swim to the side of the vessel and jockey for the best position as the tourists squeal in excitement. The two pigs swim over to the tourist boat and begin treading water around it before begging for food . With the prospect of food and none as of yet being provided, the two animals becoming increasingly demanding as they tread the shallow water. They soon jump onto the edge of the boat, hang their trotters over the side of it and begin begging for food from those on board. Eventually the two pigs receive food from the people on the boat and continue to hang onto the side of it with their mouths wide open in anticipation. The video concludes with the two pigs \\u2013 with satisfied appetites \\u2013 returning to the beach. Jumping up onto the boat the two pigs hang their trotters over the side of it in search of a snack . There they are greeted by even more of their kind and collectively make their way over to another boat in the hope of receiving even more food. Discussing the encounter, the filmmaker wrote online: \\u2018They nearly turned our boat over.\\u2019 The video was taken on Big Major Cay \\u2013 known locally as Pig Beach \\u2013 on Exuma, a district of the Bahamas that consists of over 360 islands. Becoming more vocal, the two pigs hang off the side of the boat and demand that they be fed . Eventually the pigs' cries for food are answered and they are fed by a person on the boat . There are many theories as to how the pigs arrived at the island. Some believe that a group of sailors dropped the pigs off at the beach with the intention of coming back to cook and eat them, but they didn't return. Others say that the pigs survived a shipwreck and managed to swim to shore. And perhaps the most cynical and least romantic suggestion is that the pigs are part of a business scheme to attract tourists to the Bahamas.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"highlights\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Photographer\\u00a0Graham Hewer captured the jaw-dropping scene at\\u00a0Kruger National Park in South Africa .\\nThe impala didn't turn and run after the crocodile popped out of the water and came within inches of it .\\nEven though the crocodile was close enough to attack it, the impala continued to drink from the lake .\",\n          \"Megan Blair Baker, 25, has been accused of sexual contact with a 17-year-old Sherwood Cass High School student .\\nShe reportedly had sex with the teenager on a school bus in January .\\nMrs Baker was suspended from the school on paid leave and is out on $7,500 bond .\",\n          \"The pigs swim through the crystal clear sea and tread water by the boat .\\nVideo shows pigs jumping onto the side of the boat and begging for food .\\nOnce fed the animals jump down and head towards another boat .\\nAmusing encounter\\u00a0took place on Big Major Cay, known as Pig Beach .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"b189166be7b1dc93f635d7860d4978498608ae07\",\n          \"0d51202d0a78a1ed8c02b5e93d8f643fb5ff0399\",\n          \"c513500c9c53726b4ed0065b32bbca651c64b368\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Karen Davis from Port Pirie in South Australia was captured streaking by the Google camera cars for the popular Google Maps app, which allows users to zoom in on certain streets and towns in cities all over the world with a 360-degree view. However the 38-year-old mother, who plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday, has hit back at 'flat-tittie chicks' claiming they are not confident enough with their own bodies and should focus on how they look. Karen Davis (pictured) from Port Pirie has caused controversy after a picture appeared on Google Maps Street View showing her bearing her size-K breasts . In the image, Ms Davis can be seen holding her arms up in the air with her T-shirt hunched up around her neck bearing her breasts, as she follows the Google camera cars around the street. Her sons are playing in the background and an unknown man stands at the fence watching. Across the road, a neighbour is lounging on her outdoor furniture, watching the whole thing unfold. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Ms Davis was in tears over the nasty comments coming from her community after she was branded a 'bad mother' and 'pure filth' for her raunchy behaviour. 'They are narrow-minded people who are not happy with their own bodies,' she said. Posting on her Facebook account, Ms Davis addressed the fact that she pursued the car through Barry Street in Port Pirie until they got the perfect shot and believes locals are jealous of her antics. 'Haters hate, you got the guts to do it?' she posted on Facebook after the photo went public. Ms Davis had issues with her siz-K breasts in her 20's and is finally ready to embrace them and she plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday . 'All the flat-tittie chicks think I am disgusting. Big-boob envy has hit Port Pirie.' Taking to Facebook, disgusted commenters attacked Ms Davis' parenting skills after it became clear that her two sons were in the background of the picture. 'I'm sure your children will be proud of their mother that is probably going to cause them a lot of embarrassment,' one Facebook commenter said. 'Oh goodness. Can't even begin to imagine how her children are feeling,' another user said. However a select few came out in support of Ms Davis's show on Google Maps. The mother says she is happy the picture appeared online and thought it was funny . 'Let her go, she's having some fun, Pirie people need to lighten up a bit. if more lovely ladies would get them out more often the world would be a much happier place,' one commenter said. Ms Davis told Daily Mail Australia that she thought the act would be funny and that it was an item she has now ticked off her bucket list. She also said that she has a friend in the United Kingdom and she thought it would brighten up his day if he saw the image online. 'I have a friend in the UK. If he looks on there he will smile,' she said. Ms Davis wasn't sure that the photo would make it on to Google Maps but she said she is delighted that it did. Ms Davis criticised 'flat-tittie chicks' and claimed they needed to focus on their own bodies . 'I think maybe some need to start their own bucket list and leave mine alone,' she said. She also revealed that since the photo has been released she has attracted a whole host of new friend requests on Facebook. Many young men have tried to befriend her but she has not accepted any of them. Ms Davis said she has only learnt to embrace her size-K breasts in the last few years after spending her youth hiding them away. 'I \\u00a0always got picked on and it wasn't until late in my 20's that I became confident in myself,' she said. While Ms Davis enjoyed herself bearing her breasts on the street, her neighbour sat on her lounger watching from next door . She also revealed that she has to buy her bras online from the UK as they do not make size-K bras in Australia. 'It would be nice if they made my size bra in Australia,' she said. Ms Davis said that she would do it all again, even considering the backlash the image has received. 'It's my life not theirs,' she said. 'When you point your finger at me, you have 4 pointing back at yourself.' Some people online have suggested that she should be formally charged for her display but she has contacted the police who have confirmed that they have 'no concerns'.\",\n          \"Goal hero Christophe Berra said Scotland were rewarded for their patience with a late winner in the 1-0 victory against Northern Ireland. The Ipswich defender headed home in the 85th minute from a Matt Ritchie corner in the friendly\\u00a0at Hampden Park\\u00a0on Wednesday night. Scotland keeper Christophe Berra celebrates scoring the winner against Northern Ireland . Berra's goal finally broke the resistance of Northern Ireland and goalkeeper Michael McGovern, who had frustrated Scotland with a succession of saves. He said: 'It was a difficult game, they made it very difficult. When teams do that it's very hard to break them down. 'Sometimes games are won on set pieces and luckily enough I managed to get my head on the end of a good corner kick and it just sneaked in.' Scotland boss Gordon Strachan was happy with a win and a clean sheet as preparation for Sunday's Euro 2016 qualifier against\\u00a0Gibraltar. Christophe Berra gets above his marker to head the ball into the corner for a late winner for Scotland . Bournemouth star Matt Ritchie, who made his debut in Wednesday night's game, controls the ball in midfield . He said: 'The start was good, lots of efforts on goals, McGovern played very well but after half an hour it became a friendly feel. But we kept plugging away and doing the right things. And to win the game and keep a clean sheet is good.' Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill insisted there more positives than negatives following the narrow defeat. He said: 'When you make so many substitutions, you are continually changing markers from set-pieces. Under normal circumstances, I don't think we'd have lost that goal - and it's disappointing for Michael McGovern who had a good game. 'We can take an awful lot (from the performance). We ended up with three 20-year-olds or under-20-year-olds on the pitch. The likes of Paddy McNair, Luke McCullough, Ryan McLaughlin - it's great for those lads to get minutes in this type of game.'

While some of the presumed presidential candidate's party members have come to her defense, many lawmakers headed for the exits this week as reporters asked them for their opinion on the way Clinton handled her email while at the State Department. Democratic strategists were more willing discuss the scandal - but what they had to say, Clinton probably won't like. Democrats are running for cover this week as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton takes fire from the press for over her cyber hygiene.\\u00a0Officials at 1600 Pennsylvania now claim they didn't know that Clinton was solely using her personal email address to conduct government business . Officials at 1600 Pennsylvania now claim they didn't know that Clinton was solely using her personal email address to conduct government business until Congress reopened an investigation into the Benghazi attack. According to the Associated Press, it was the\\u00a0White House counsel's office that ordered the State Department to retrieve Clinton's old emails. That version of events was never relayed to the press at large, despite the fact that President Barack Obama's spokesman Josh Earnest spent the better part of his briefings with reporters on Tuesday and Wednesday answering questions about what the White House knew about Clinton's exclusive use of her personal email address, when it knew it, and a host of other related inquires. He deflected as often as possible and referred press to the State Department and Clinton. Earnest did note that Clinton's detractors and government watchdogs haven't provided 'any evidence' that would indicate that the former administration official and her team are 'not being forthright' about turning in copies of all of her email communications from her four years in the president's cabinet. His comments were hardly a ringing endorsement of Clinton's honesty, however. The White House got a break on Thursday when a snowstorm bore down on Washington, D.C., giving Earnest cause to cancel his daily meeting with the press corps. A large-scale, public Q and A session isn't likely to make Friday's schedule, either, as the president is travelling to South Carolina for an event at Benedict College. Usually a spokesperson for the president holds a small gaggle with press riding Air Force One on those days. Unwilling or unable to say who in at the State Department was responsible for making sure Clinton fully complied with the demand, the deputy spokesman there, Marie Harf, directed journalists to the former secretary of state. Pressed to declare that she was 'confident' that all of Clinton's pertinent emails were now in the possession of the federal government she said, 'what I\\u2019m saying is her staff has stated that anything related to her work has been given to the State Department.' 'But this is obviously a confirmation her staff has to make,' she added, after a reporter asked if she has any 'reason to doubt' the veracity of Clinton's claims. She said she did not. Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said Wednesday night that he thinks the Clinton is adding to her woes by keeping silent.'It would be good to get out there and answer these questions.' Clinton is pictured here in 2008 taking questions from the press during the Democratic National Convention a few months before she was sworn in as Secretary of State . Clinton's former colleagues in Congress were won't to discuss the issue at all. 'Can we talk about it later? I have to go to my vote,' Clinton's successor in the Senate, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, told the National Journal. The news publication said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, normally outspoken, excused herself for the same reason. 'I don't know enough about it to appropriately respond,' New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said. Congressional Democrats were equally reticent to comment to CNN. 'I'm not up to speed on it. I'm really not,' Montana Sen. Jon Tester told the network on Wednesday - more than a day after story broke. 'Check back,' Tester, the chair of Senate Democrats' campaign arm, said. North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp also asked for a mulligan. 'I don't know enough about what those rules are, honestly, to comment,' she claimed. And the list goes on. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin told National Journal he doesn't 'know the facts' but 'it sounds like somebody made a mistake.' 'She's going to have to give an answer to it,' Vermont Rep. Peter Welch told CNN. Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings, the ranking member on the House's Select Committee on Benghazi, said it's not his job to protect Clinton, his party's possible nominee for president. 'I want to be clear, I am not trying to defend Hillary Clinton,' he said. 'I am trying to defend the truth \\u2026 we have some things we are going to try and figure out.' If Clinton can't make the email story go away quick enough, she could go from presidential front runner in 2016 to persona non-grata. Supporters of Clintons are shown here in 2008 after she lost that year's nomination to Barack Obama . Retiring California Sen. Barbara Boxer was one of the few Democratic senators to stand by Clinton. 'That's a nothing burger. Total,' she told National Journal. 'There isn't one secretary of State that ever did that because the law didn't change until after she left, so they're making a mountain out of a molehill,' she added. Likewise, Delaware Sen. Tom Carper said he'd 'be surprised if a number of secretaries of State hadn't done that for as long as we've had email.' 'That's all I'm going to say,' he added. New York Rep. Steve Israel blamed Republicans \\u00a0for the mess and accused them of 'trying to manufacture or amplify crisis or scandal.' 'That's what they do here,' he told CNN. 'Pretty soon we'll have a special investigative committee for every action that Hillary Clinton takes. There will be a special select committee on her breakfast, her lunch and her dinner and what she had in between. Just add this to the list.' It is true that Clinton's predecessors also used their personal email addresses to conduct official business. But other secretaries of state did not create private email addresses the day before their confirmation votes for the explicit purpose of communicating with their future staff. Nor did they house their email addresses on a privately owned server that is inaccessible to the government and can be wiped clean at their leisure. They weren't actively considering a bid for president, either. Reporters showered White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest with questions on Wednesday about the Clinton email controversy.\\u00a0The White House got a break on Thursday when a snowstorm bore down on Washington, D.C., giving Earnest cause to cancel his daily meeting with the press corps . Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said Wednesday night that he thinks the Clinton is adding to her woes by keeping silent. 'It would be good to get out there and answer these questions,' Axelrod said on MSNBC's The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell, according to The Hill. 'Why did she used a separate email? How did she secure that email? Was there another email through which she communicated with people?' he asked. 'By not answering these questions, they are allowing this story to fester in ways that are unhelpful. So lack of speed kills in this case,' the former White House official said. The State Department has said that Clinton had just one email address during her tenure there - the account in question. And Clinton, first through a spokesman, and then through Twitter has touched on the issue. She has not explained why she did what she did, though, or responded to any of the other questions Axelrod - and the media - put forward. A Democratic strategist who spoke to The Hill warned that if Clinton can't make the story go away quick enough, she could go from presidential front runner to persona non-grata. 'We\\u2019re probably a month or so away [from the campaign launch] and if this is not handled really well within the next three to six weeks, you\\u2019re going to see chatter among Democratic operatives saying, \\\"Maybe we need another person in this race.\\\" And that is really problematic.' 'When you do stuff like this, man, you just raise a lot of concerns and red flags,' The Hill's source said. 'It\\u2019s kinda weird.'\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"highlights\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 13300,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"An Italian weather website says the snowfall measured 100.8 inches .\\nThe world record for 24 hours of snow is 75.8 inches, set in Colorado in 1921 .\",\n          \"Lloyd Lindquist of Leesburg pleaded guilty to voyeurism on Friday .\\nHas been prohibited from having unsupervised contact with minors .\\nWas caught out by a teenager attending Tavares High School .\\nStudent found the camera in May 2014.

              "0  (CNN)Share, and your gift will be multiplied. That may sound like an esoteric adage, but when Zully Broussard selflessly decided to give one of her kidneys to a stranger, her generosity paired up with big data. It resulted in six patients receiving transplants. That surprised and wowed her. \"I thought I was going to help this one person who I don't know, but the fact that so many people can have a life extension, that's pretty big,\" Broussard told CNN affiliate KGO. She may feel guided in her generosity by a higher power. \"Thanks for all the support and prayers,\" a comment on a Facebook page in her name read. \"I know this entire journey is much bigger than all of us. I also know I'm just the messenger.\" CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the page. But the power that multiplied Broussard's gift was data processing of genetic profiles from donor-recipient pairs. It works on a simple swapping principle but takes it to a much higher level, according to California Pacific Medical Cen...   \n",
              "1  (CNN)On the 6th of April 1996, San Jose Clash and DC United strode out in front of 31,683 expectant fans at the Spartan Stadium in San Jose, California. The historic occasion was the first ever Major League Soccer match -- a brave new dawn for the world's favorite sport in a land its charms had yet to conquer. Summarizing the action for ESPN, commentator Ty Keough eagerly described the momentous \"birth of a new era for American soccer.\" Looking back at footage from that balmy evening now it's hard not to feel a certain nostalgia. Baggy shirts, questionable hairstyles and strange rule adaptations to make games more exciting were all part of the formative MLS experience. Countdown clocks were employed to provide drama at the end of each half. Even more bizarrely, tied games were settled by shootouts that saw attacking players run with the ball from 35-yards out before attempting to beat the opposing goalkeeper. As the MLS prepares to mark the beginning of its 20th season, it's hard t...   \n",
              "2  (CNN)French striker Bafetimbi Gomis, who has a history of fainting, said he is now \"feeling well\" after collapsing during Swansea's 3-2 loss at Tottenham in the Premier League on Wednesday. The worrying incident occurred in the first half at White Hart Lane -- after Tottenham scored in the seventh minute -- but the 29-year-old left the pitch conscious following about five minutes of treatment. The Guardian added that he was wearing an oxygen mask. Play was temporarily stopped before resuming. As the match progressed, Swansea tweeted that Gomis was \"fine,\" with manager Garry Monk using the same word to describe Gomis' condition. Gomis spent the night in hospital as a precaution, Swansea said on its website. \"I wanted to reassure you concerning my health,\" Gomis told the website. \"It actually looks much scarier than it is physically dangerous, and I am feeling well now. \"I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father's health, which requires me to go back and f...   \n",
              "3  (CNN)It was an act of frustration perhaps more commonly associated with golf's fictional anti-hero Happy Gilmore than the world's reigning No 1. player. But when Rory McIlroy pulled his second shot on the eighth hole of the WGC Cadillac Championship into a lake Friday, he might as well have been channeling the much loved Adam Sandler character. Before continuing his round with a dropped ball, the four-time major winner launched the 3-iron used to play the offending shot into the water as well. \"(It) felt good at the time,\" a rueful McIlroy later said of the incident in comments carried by the PGA Tour website. \"I just let frustration get the better of me. It was heat of the moment, and I mean, if it had of been any other club I probably wouldn't have but I didn't need a 3‑iron for the rest of the round so I thought, why not.\" The club \"must have went a good 60, 70 yards,\" he joked. McIlroy composed himself to finish with a second round of 70, leaving him one-under for the tournamen...   \n",

The search has drawn hundreds of volunteers on foot and online. The parents of Cayman Naib, 13, have been communicating through the Facebook group \"Find Cayman\" since a day after his disappearance, according to close friend David Binswanger. Newtown Police say Cayman was last seen wearing a gray down winter jacket, black ski pants and hiking boots. He could be in the Radnor-Wayne area, roughly 20 miles from Philadelphia, or may have purchased a train ticket to Philadelphia, according to an alert posted on Facebook. \"We think that he got a email from school and was upset by it and left as an impulsive act,\" Farid Naib, Cayman's father, wrote Thursday on the group page. \"We have spoken to his friends and they do not know where he is.

Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. \"I don\\'t plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. \"I don\\'t think I\\'ll be particularly extravagant. \"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film \"Hostel: Part II,\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he\\'ll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. \"I\\'ll definitely have some sort of party,\" he said in an interview. \"Hopefully none of you will be reading about it.\" Radcliffe\\'s earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. \"People are always looking to say \\'kid star goes off the rails,\\'\" he told reporters last month. \"But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them.\" His latest outing as the boy wizard in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films.  Watch I-Reporter give her review of Potter\\'s latest » . There is life beyond Potter, however. The Londoner has filmed a TV movie called \"My Boy Jack,\" about author Rudyard Kipling and his son, due for release later this year. He will also appear in \"December Boys,\" an Australian film about four boys who escape an orphanage. Earlier this year, he made his stage debut playing a tortured teenager in Peter Shaffer\\'s \"Equus.\" Meanwhile, he is braced for even closer media scrutiny now that he\\'s legally an adult: \"I just think I\\'m going to be more sort of fair game,\" he told Reuters.

            "(CNN)Former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez will need to keep his lawyers even after being convicted of murder and other charges in the death of Odin Lloyd. The 25-year-old potentially faces three more trials -- one criminal and two civil actions. Next up is another murder trial in which he is accused of killing two men and wounding another person near a Boston nightclub in July 2012. Prosecutors have said Hernandez fatally shot Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado when he fired into their 2003 BMW.  Another passenger was wounded and two others were uninjured. Hernandez pleaded not guilty at his arraignment. The trial was originally slated for May 28, but Jake Wark, spokesman for the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office, said Wednesday the trial had been postponed and no new date had been set. \"We expect to select a new court date in the coming days and then set the amended trial track. The Suffolk indictments allege two counts of first-degree murder for the July 16, 2012, shooting deaths of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado in Boston's South End; three counts of armed assault with intent to murder and one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon for shots fired at three surviving victims; and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm,\" he said. The families of de Abreu and Furtado filed civil suits against Hernandez, and a judge froze his $5 million in assets, pending the outcome of the double-murder trial. The freeze includes the disputed $3.3 million signing bonus payment Hernandez claims he is owed by the New England Patriots. Hernandez is also being sued by a man who claims Hernandez shot him while they were in a limousine in Miami in February 2013. Alexander Bradley claims the then-New England Patriot tight end wounded him after the two got into a fight at a Miami strip club. In a lawsuit filed four months later, Bradley said Hernandez fired at him during a limo ride after leaving the club and that Hernandez intentionally \"possessed a gun which he was not legally licensed to have.\" Hernandez's lawyers have argued he couldn't defend himself properly while on trial in Massachusetts. There was no criminal charge in the case. And then there is the grievance over unpaid bonus money filed by the NFL players union on behalf of Hernandez, who signed a contract in 2012 that potentially was worth more than $40 million. If the grievance is heard by the league, Hernandez will be represented by the the National Football League Players' Association. Who was Odin Lloyd?

Japanese armies attempted to destroy the Allied forces at Imphal and invade India, but were driven back into Burma with heavy losses. Together with the simultaneous Battle of Kohima on the road by which the encircled Allied forces at Imphal were relieved, the battle was the turning point of the Burma campaign, part of the South-East Asian theatre of World War II.[4] The Japanese defeat at Kohima and Imphal was the largest up until that time,[5] with many of the Japanese deaths resulting from starvation, disease and exhaustion suffered during their retreat.[3][4] According to voting in a contest run by the British National Army Museum, the Battle of Imphal was bestowed as Britain's Greatest Battle in 2013.[6][7]\n",
